# Installation

To run the FEDM code, it is required to install the Docker. On Ubuntu/Debian Linux systems, this can be done using the official repository in the following way:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt-get install \
    apt-transport-https \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    gnupg-agent \
    software-properties-common
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt-key fingerprint 0EBFCD88
sudo add-apt-repository \
   "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
   $(lsb_release -cs) \
   stable"
sudo apt update
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
```

After installing the Docker, the latest stable FEniCS image (FEniCS 2019.1.0) can be run using the following command in the terminal:

```bash
sudo docker run -ti \
    -v $(pwd):/home/fenics/shared \
    -v /tmp \
    quay.io/fenicsproject/stable
```

Note that repeating above described procedure always creates a new container, which may eventually exhaust the local storage. Therefore, it is suggested to restart the same container using
 ```bash
 docker start my_container
 docker attach my_container
 ```

The following steps will also let you run Docker as a non-root user:

```bash
sudo groupadd docker # create docker group if none exists
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER # Add self to docker group
# ... log out and log back in, or call `newgrp docker` ...
docker run -ti \
    -v $(pwd):/home/fenics/shared \
    -v /tmp \
    quay.io/fenicsproject/stable
```

Here, it is assumed that the FEDM code is located in the subdirectory `fedm` within the current directory. Now, switch to the shared volume mounted in the container to use FEDM:

```bash
cd shared/fedm
```

The code directory has the following structure:

```
fedm
├── examples
│   ├── glow_discharge
│   ├── streamer_discharge
│   └── time_of_flight
├── fedm
│   ├── file_io.py
│   ├── functions.py
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── physical_constants.py
│   ├── __pycache__
│   └── utils.py
├── LICENSE
├── pyproject.toml
├── README.md
├── run_tests.sh
├── setup.cfg
├── setup.py
└── tests
    ├── integrated_tests
    └── unit_tests
```

FEDM can be installed within the Docker container using:

```bash
python3 -m pip install --user .
```

The directory `Examples` contains the code for the three case studies described in detail [here](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6595/acc54b). One can execute each example by running the following command in the corresponding directory (you may need to use `sudo`):

```bash
python3 fedm-name_of_example.py
```

or in parallel using MPI:

```bash
mpirun –np 8 python3 fedm-name_of_example.py
```
